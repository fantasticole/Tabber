#Tabber

The Tabber Chrome extension tracks when tabs are opened and closed and displays that information in a popup.

The extension offers the user the option to view a D3.js graph, which opens in a new tab, to view hourly averages.

The information is stored in Chrome's Local Storage and can be downloaded as a JSON or a TSV from the popup.

To look at information in local storage:
	'chrome://extensions > Tab Counter > Inspect views: background.html (new window) > Resources > Local Storage'
